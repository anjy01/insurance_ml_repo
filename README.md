# Insurance Cost Prediction API 
This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts insurance charges based on customer attributes such as age, BMI,number of children, sex, smoking status, and region.  
It demonstrates the full ML lifecycle — from data preprocessing and model training to deploying a prediction API.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Build a regression model to predict insurance costs
- Save trained artifacts (model, scaler, encoders)
- Serve predictions via a lightweight API
- Showcase production-ready ML structure
